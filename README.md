This project is to create a simple recipe website.

Unfortunately, I forgot to commit my files at the intervals indicated in the lesson. So going forward, I'll need to make an effort to get as much practice with git/github as possible. The add/commit/push process was confusing to me. Add/commit are both processes that take place locally through git. Push is used to push my commits onto GitHub.
