        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="container">   
                <ul class="myUL">
                    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cup milk</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
